# Week 1 Assignment: SQL and NULLs Robert Williams IS 362

# 1A. How many airplanes have listed speeds?
# Answer: 23 airplanes are with listed speeds.

# 1B.What is the minimum listed speed and the maximum listed speeds?
#Answer: The max speed of 432 and the minimum speeds of 90
#SQL Code Bottom Below

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM planes
	WHERE speed IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(speed) FROM planes;

SELECT MAX(speed) FROM planes;
SELECT MIN(speed) FROM planes;

# 2A. What is the total distance flown by all of the planes in January 2013? 

# Answer: Total distance flown by all the planes in 1/2013 is 27,188,805 miles on 27,004 number of flights.

# 2B. What is the total distance flown by all of the planes in January 2013 where the tailnum is missing?

# The total distance flown by all of the planes in 1/2013 with missing tailnum is 81,763 miles on 155 flights

#SQL code Below

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Flights', SUM(distance) AS 'Total Distance' FROM flights
	WHERE (year = 2013 AND month = 1);

SELECT COUNT(tailnum) FROM flights;		
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights
	WHERE tailnum IS NOT NULL;			
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights
	WHERE tailnum IS NULL;				

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Flights', SUM(distance) AS 'Total Distance' FROM flights
	WHERE (year = 2013 AND month = 1)
    AND tailnum IS NULL;

# 3. What is the total distance flown for all planes on July 5, 2013 grouped by aircraft manufacturer?
# Write this statement first using an INNER JOIN, then using a LEFT OUTER JOIN. How do your results compare? 

#INNER JOIN:  July 5 2013 has 682 flights with a total distance of 755,337 miles
#LEFT OUTER JOIN: July 5 2013 has 140 extra with flights with a total of 127,671 miles

#SQL Code Below

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Flights', SUM(distance) AS 'Total Distance', manufacturer AS 'Manufacturer'
FROM flights
INNER JOIN planes
ON flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum
WHERE (flights.year = 2013 AND flights.month = 7 AND flights.day = 5)
GROUP BY manufacturer;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Flights', SUM(distance) AS 'Total Distance', manufacturer AS 'Manufacturer'
FROM flights
LEFT JOIN planes
ON flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum
WHERE (flights.year = 2013 AND flights.month = 7 AND flights.day = 5)
GROUP BY manufacturer;

# 4. Write and answer at least one question of your own choosing that joins information 
# from at least three of the tables in the flights database.
# What airports had the most filghts as destinations on July 7, 2013 grouped by manufacturer

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Flights', name AS 'Airport', manufacturer AS 'Manufacturer'
FROM flights
LEFT JOIN airports ON flights.dest = airports.faa
LEFT JOIN planes ON flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum
WHERE (flights.year = 2013 AND flights.month = 7 AND flights.day = 5)
GROUP BY faa, manufacturer;
